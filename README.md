## ðŸ“Œ Web-Based Student Portfolio Application for the Department of Business and Informatics at Poliwangi

### ðŸš« Source Code Not Included
This project was developed in collaboration with Politeknik Negeri Banyuwangi as part of an internal application development initiative. In accordance with the confidentiality policy of the partner institution, I am not permitted to share the source code publicly.


### ðŸ§© The Problem
Politeknik Negeri Banyuwangi is a vocational education institution with many active and high-achieving students who produce various works in fields such as technology, research, and the arts. However, there is currently no dedicated platform to professionally showcase and document these works to the wider public. As a result, student achievements often go unnoticed, and lecturers face difficulties in identifying students with strong potential for learning support or research collaboration.

To address this issue, a student portfolio website is needed as a platform for students to present their achievements, projects, and talents. Through this website, students can publish various works such as final projects, independent research, internships, and other relevant extracurricular activities.

This website is expected to serve not only as a tool for appreciation and documentation but also as a resource for lecturers in identifying students who meet specific criteria. Additionally, it can act as a reference for industry partners or academic institutions interested in evaluating student competencies. In the long term, this platform aims to foster a culture of creativity and innovation among students and strengthen the role of vocational education in producing high-quality human resources.
